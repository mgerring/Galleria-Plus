Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and streamline their WordPress photo galleries.

== Description ==

Photo Galleria is a simple, yet elegant, plugin for photographers and designers who want to beautify and simplify their WordPress photo galleries. The Photo Galleria plugin filters the default WordPress gallery shortcode and replaces it with an elegant jQuery-powered gallery.  Simply upload photos as normal and the Photo Galleria plugin will create a photo gallery with fade-in and fade-out effects common on flash-based websites. All the transitions happen inline without having to navigate to multiple WordPress attachment pages. This plugin comes with different design options, which you can select on the Photo Galleria Settings page.  Pretty neat, eh?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does mine not work? =

You likely have a plugin that is inserting a conflicting javascript (the stuff that runs Photo Galleria). Deactivate your plugins, one by one, to see which one is the culprit.  If that doesn't work, switch to the default WordPress theme to see if your theme is actually adding conflicting javascript.  If it is, consider upgrading to a theme that enqueues javascript the smart way.  Finally, delete your browser cache after completing the steps above.

= What about titles and captions? =

Yep.  If you got 'em, this plugin can display 'em  Just make sure you add yours to each image after uploading.

= Can I have multiple Photo Gallerias on my homepage, archive page, page or post? =

No.  Why?  Photo Galleria loads large images all at once.  If you have, say, 10 posts on your archive page, each containing 10 images, your users would have to wait for 100 large images to load before they could even begin to interact with your Photo Galleria.  This would make for a terrible user experience.

= How do I change colors, thumbnail sizes or icons? =

Virtually every aspect of each theme is customizable with CSS.  Themes are located here: /wp-content/plugins/photo-galleria/themes/
